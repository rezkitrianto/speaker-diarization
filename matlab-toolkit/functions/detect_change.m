function change_points = detect_change (filename,mode,lamda,thresh,verbose)
%
% Input: string filename that can be read using function 'audioread'
%        function can also take MFCC vectors of audio files as input
% Output: change_points are in seconds.%
%
% detect_change returns change_points which are points in file
% filename at which there was a change in the speaker. There is no
% indication as to which speaker spoke when. For that refer to function
% cluster_segments.
%
% Example: C = detect_change ('haal_behaal.wav')
%
% C = [ 9.01 16.70 43.55 ]
